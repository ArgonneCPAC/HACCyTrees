Creating Branch-Matrices
========================

.. currentmodule:: haccytrees.mergertrees

.. figure:: branchmatrix_mass.svg

   Example of a branch matrix for a single tree, showing the branch mass. Each
   row corresponds to the main progenitor branch of a branch, and each column to
   a simulation snapshot. After a halo merges, the mass by default is set to ``0``
   (white).
